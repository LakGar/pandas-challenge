# School Performance Analysis

This project provides an analysis of school performance based on various factors such as spending per student, school size, and school type. The analysis examines key metrics including average math and reading scores, percentage of students passing math and reading, and overall passing rates.

## Key Findings:

1. **Spending Per Student:**
   - Schools with lower per-student spending (<$585) generally have higher average scores and passing rates compared to those with higher spending ranges.

2. **School Type:**
   - Charter schools consistently outperform District schools in both math and reading scores, as well as in overall passing rates.

3. **School Size:**
   - Smaller schools (<1000 students) tend to have better academic performance compared to larger schools (2000-5000 students).

## Data Overview:

The analysis categorizes schools into different groups based on their spending per student, size, and type (Charter or District). The findings are summarized in tables that show average scores and passing percentages for each category.

## Purpose:

This document is intended to provide insights into how various factors impact school performance, with the goal of identifying areas for improvement and better resource allocation.
